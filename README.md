# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me:
- :heart_eyes: I am a passionate *aspiring* data analyst dedicated to leveraging data-driven insights to improve public health and biomedical research.
- :computer: I am skilled in R, Python, SQL, data visualization using Power BI & Python, and well-versed in Microsoft Office suite.
- :student: I am currently studying to be a data analyst via [NTUC LearningHub SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme (SCTP) Associate Data Analyst](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ntuc-learninghub_sctp-associate-data-analyst-activity-7117805423038001152-6exr) Programme.
- :man_office_worker: Previously I worked as a research officer at A*Star and a research assistant at Hummingbird Bioscience, and a operation manager at Resilient Secure Consultancy Pte Ltd.

I am using GitHub to showcase what I have learnt during my journey to become a data analyst and hopefully a data scientist (in the future).

Fun fact: :weight_lifting_man: I am a cheerleader and appeared in "[Bring It On: Worldwide #Cheersmack](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9529637/)".
